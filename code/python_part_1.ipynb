Together we will write some code to perform a few small tasks -- nothing that you probably couldn't do with other tools at your disposal. But we'll intentionally be going slow, asking you to think about what's happening at every step. This work -- for those humanists out there, think of it as a kind of close reading -- will help you develop your conceptual model of Python (and of programming languages more generally)."
